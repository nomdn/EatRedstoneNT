Code2000 is a Unicode-based TrueType font striving to eventually represent all 
of the extended characters and symbols assigned to the Basic Multilingual 
Plane of Unicode in a consistent typeface. 

Its developer has tried to create a distinctive style or flavor for the 
characters while remaining faithful to the classic letter forms of the 
various scripts. 

Code2000 is a work-in-process. It currently (Version 1.171) has over 60000 
glyphs. 

Although it is more-or-less readable at 12 - 18 point, it is much clearer at 
about 24 point. Some of the dingbats should be at least 36 point. With font- 
smoothing it looks good at normal sizes.
